## Dashboard to display cost savings for students that use open educational resources

- This is what I am working on for my practicum this semester
- I used to Python and the Dash framework to create this -- Dash is used to create interactive data dashboards using plotly as its built-in visualization library
- Now that the basic layout is done I will focus on styling it more
- After it is hosted somewhere I will place the link in the README, for now I will take some screenshots and post them below
